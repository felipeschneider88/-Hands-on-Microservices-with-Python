- To install just the frontend read the [Frontend installation guide](docs/install/frontend.md)


## About the Video Course
This course covers microservice fundamentals and advanced topics with a hands-on demonstration of how to implement microservices using real-world examples. Learn how to design and build a microservice software architecture in Python. 
You will learn to make your applications more reliable and fault-tolerant using microservices with Python, no matter how complex the business logic. This course demonstrates how to design and build an application using a series of microservices. The application in question is an order management system, which we will split up into individual services. In a hands-on manner, you will learn topics such as data modeling, data storage, writing API requests, and you will learn to secure, monitor, and scale your microservices.
Finally, you will learn to use Docker's containerization technology to isolate, manage, monitor, and deploy microservices in Docker containers.
